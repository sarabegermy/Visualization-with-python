# Students Performance in Exams
## by Sara Mohammad El-Begermy

## Dataset

> Marks scored by the students in high school students from the United States. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) is 72.04 kB. The data is already clean. But I added a column for the total score. I ordered the parental level of education column, as well as the race/ethnicity column which was ordered alphabetically.


## Summary of Findings

> Exploration of all variables in the Univariate Exploration    
> Exploration of all pairs in the Bivariate Exploration
> Comparison between maths, reading and writing scores in the Multivariate Exploration
> All variables except the gender are aggregated in one figure in the Multivariate Exploration. All scores are aggregated in 'total percentage'; columns represent different groups or races; rows represent different levels of education sorted in ascending order; each sub figure is divided into 2 violins; the left one for standard lunch and the right one for the free/reduced lunch; each violin is splitted into 2 colours: light brown for students who finished test preparation course and blue for others.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Do the scores follow the normal distribution?     
> Comparision between females and males in different subjects    
> How does lunch affect scores?   
> How does parents level of education affect their children's scores?
